See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Is clappr.min.js (0.2.1) properly minimized?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _clappr_ between _0.1.12_ and _0.2.1_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  - assets/HLSPlayer.swf\n  - assets/Player-Regular.eot\n  - assets/Player-Regular.svg\n  - assets/Player-Regular.ttf\n  - assets/Player.swf\n  - assets/Roboto.ttf\n  - assets/default.png\n  - assets/watermark.png\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing..
