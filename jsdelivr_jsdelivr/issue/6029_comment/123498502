      "@jonathanKingston I meant an example of how a website shows links with SRI. Maybe a js library with own CDN or something.\nRight now we only show the direct links, this change would require us to show the full script tags which is not pretty.\n\n@megawac api-sync already uses a lot of RAM and hits all the Github limits, I am afraid this change would make it even more unstable and slower. Restarting the app would generate thousands of HTTP requests and crazy CPU load.\n"
