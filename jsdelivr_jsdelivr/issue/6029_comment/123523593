      "So long as it is done once like post upload then the risks should be limited, if it is the client doing it when downloading the library then yeah I think it is a real issue.\n\nPoisoning GitHub would likely be much harder by their design due to their API backed from storage rather than a CDN which could farm out content to community/open run servers (I'm not saying these statements are indicative of how your CDN's are run and how GitHub is just trying to mitigate risk - less hands involved the better).\n\nIf GitHub can provide some form of fingerprint then the risk should be completely mitigated when comparing against the CDN. So in my Ember implementation I check a md5 sum matches the file before considering adding an integrity.\n"
