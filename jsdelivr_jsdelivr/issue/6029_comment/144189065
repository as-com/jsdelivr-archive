      "@jimaek in the UI I checked I had to toggle the SRI to be on; does this extra step have to be there?\n\nNope, just checked however I think they are somewhat looking at changing their SRI solution somewhat from what I can see. I will update you when I know more however right now the best solution is to disable offending SRI checks.\n"
