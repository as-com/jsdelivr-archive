      "The jsDelivr repo contains 90.000 files. Doing 90k requests and hashing each file is too much load. I am not worried so much about the RAM usage as much for the CPU usage and the performance impact on the api-sync.\n\nIs everyone here against the frontend SRI calculation? I believe it solves every single problem.\n"
