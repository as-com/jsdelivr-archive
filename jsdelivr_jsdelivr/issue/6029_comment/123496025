      "Do you know any websites that show SRI? I want to take a look.\n\nNow regarding the backend, not sure that its that easy. Algolia is fed our API, and the API gets the info from scanning our Github repo. We host A LOT of files, to add SRI that way it would require to download and hash each file. \n\n@megawac @unboundev Any ideas how to add SRI without breaking everything?\n"
