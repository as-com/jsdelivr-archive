See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help ammending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Unescaped unicode characters in _holder.js_ (at pos 65)\n  - Unescaped unicode characters in _holder.min.js_ (at pos 65)\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _holder_ between _2.4.0_ and _2.5.0_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + holder.min.js\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Approachable is better than simple._\n"
