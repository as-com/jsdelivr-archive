        "I agree with being hesitant to deleting error files/folders if there is a chance of people using them in production.  Could we de-list them from the API & website so others don't use the wrong file please?  Maybe `unlist:` in the version folders, with `ALL` flag to mean the entire version?  Open to other ideas.\nref: https://github.com/mailcheck/mailcheck/issues/81\n"
