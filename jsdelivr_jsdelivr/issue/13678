        "Downgrading a request to HTTP or getting an HTTPS certificate for a website is fairly low bar to clear.  While I understand you have to support HTTP, what about a subdomain that enforces HTTPS (via HSTS) and pins the key for ~72 hours (~~HSTS~~ HPKP)?  Ideally, projects would be able to opt-out of the non-HTTPS CDN as well.\n"
