      "When I review projects I only read the info.ini file. You point here https://github.com/mjau-mjau/x3assets\n1. Its too fresh\n2. There is no documentation\n3. There is no way to confirm if its the official repo of the project. http://imagevuex.com/x3docs does not point to the repo and its not a real doc. I still dont know what X3 is.\n\nThe point 1 can be ignored for projects that show their seriousness with good documentation or other. \n\nSo please relax and lets talk\n"
