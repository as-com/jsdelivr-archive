See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - Where is the angularjs's mainfile (_angular.min.js_) in v-_1.0.1_\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Is angular.min.js (1.3.14) properly minimized?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _angularjs_ between _1.3.9_ and _1.3.14_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + angular-scenario.js\n  - angular.js\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_It's not fully shipped until it's fast._\n"
