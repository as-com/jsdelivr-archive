See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n  - hostname 'brad.is' doesn't match either of 'www.ampersandnbspsemicolon.com', 'ampersandnbspsemicolon.com'\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _bigscreen_ between _2.0.4_ and _2.0.5_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + bigscreen.min.js.map\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Non-blocking is better than blocking._\n"
