      "Thank you for the merge! I hope I set up the auto-update feature properly.\r\n\r\nHow long should it take from the PR merge to see the updated library on the CDN? This line from the README indicates that it's pretty quick:\r\n> All changes made to this repo are synced to the CDN. It can take a few minutes for the changes to appear on the website.\r\n\r\nThe CDN is still showing an old version: http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/jquery.form"
