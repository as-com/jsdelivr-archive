See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - Where is the gsap's mainfile (_jquery.gsap.min.js_) in v-_12_\n  - Name mismatch for update.json in gsap\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _gsap_ between _1.14.2_ and _12_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  - jquery.gsap.min.js\n  - plugins/AttrPlugin.min.js\n  - plugins/BezierPlugin.min.js\n  - plugins/DirectionalRotationPlugin.min.js\n  - plugins/EndArrayPlugin.min.js\n  - plugins/KineticPlugin.min.js\n  - plugins/TextPlugin.min.js\n  - utils/Draggable.min.js\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing..
