        "Google decided to break out AngularJS into multiple scripts to allow people to use only what they want, in theory that's good but I find myself always using all of the extension modules anyway and it only add's 10K total when you look at the gzip'd versions.\n\nThis means I need to download 9 scripts from their cdn, or concat and uglify all the modules back into a singular file and put them on a customers site.\n\nTherefore I thought this might be a good submission for others as well.  I provided two versions so far, the latest stable 1.2.18 and the latest beta 1.3.0-beta.13 and I will continue to update them as google makes new releases\n\nCheers, Todd\n"
