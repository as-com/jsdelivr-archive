      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @patrickarlt, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - The \"repo\": \"esri/esri property should be wrapped in double quotes (e.g. `\"repo\": \"esri/esri = \"leaflet\",\"`) and contain no other double quotes\n  - \"repo\": \"esri/esri isn't a valid _info.ini_ property...\n  - No author property provided\n  - No description property provided\n  - No mainfile property provided\n  - Expected a `homepage` (this can be the source repo with docs)\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_It's not fully shipped until it's fast._\n"
