      "@UnbounDev When a project changes the name of the \"mainfile\" we change it in info.ini, but to make sure all previous links dont break we create a file callled `mainfile` containing the name of the mainfile for that particular version. /g/ prioritizes the separate `mainfile` per version.\n\nFor example https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/files/imagesloaded/2.1.0/mainfile\n\nWe should include this in our API so bot could read and stop complaining about missing mainfiles, they are not missing but overwritten by a local version mainfile\n"
