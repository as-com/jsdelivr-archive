See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help amending your PR...\n\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n    - opensug has no *info.ini* file buddy\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n    - *.ini* (on *info.ini*) seems odd to want to host?\n    - *.md* (on *readme.md*) seems odd to want to host?\n    - *.json* (on *update.json*) seems odd to want to host?\n  \n----------\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n*Half measures are as bad as nothing at all.*\n"
