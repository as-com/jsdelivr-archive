      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @joeey1984ad, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- There are some fundamental issues with your PR :no_good:  \n  - _files/jQuery.querystring/info.ini_ should be lowercase\n  - _files/jQuery.querystring/jquery.querystring.min.js_ should be lowercase\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - Expected a `homepage` (this can be the source repo with docs)\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - string indices must be integers, not str\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Anything added dilutes everything else._\n"
