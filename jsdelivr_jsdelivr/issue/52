        "I noticed that your lodash page lists the `lodash.backbone.js` build as default:\nhttp://www.jsdelivr.com/#!lodash\nbut seems the `lodash.js` is the default: https://github.com/bestiejs/lodash/blob/master/README.md\n\nLooks like an alphabetical sorting issue.  Is there a way to flag a sub-version as 'default' please?\nThanks for your service & hosting the rainbow of lodash flavors!\n"
