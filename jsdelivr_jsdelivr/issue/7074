        "I would really like to include the .src.js and .min.js.map files. In my other package covjson-reader I was ok with skipping them as the .src.js file was already transpiled (from ES6) and it wasn't so useful in general. But here there's no transpilation so I find it very useful to include those files. Since this is a very small library I think it doesn't hurt. (both .src.js and .min.js.map are just 4k)\n"
