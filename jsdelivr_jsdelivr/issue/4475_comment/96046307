      "@jimaek mentioned he would prefer it as `leaflet.esri` in https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/4474#issuecomment-96042795 since this is a plugin for Leaflet. It looks like that the pattern for a lot of other stuff like `angular.all` or `bootstrap.calender`. I suppose I could just change the `packageManager` to `github` to get around this but it does look like a validation bug in the bot.\n\n@jimaek Your call. I'm more then happy to reopen using `github` as opposed to NPM if you want.\n"
