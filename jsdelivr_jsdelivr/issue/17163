        "Added a single file (autobahn.min.js). The current S3 bucket has just been pulled by the developers due to people linking live sites to it and racking up a bill. Typically this file is included with projects and hosted locally, but inevitably some people want to link to a hosted location, and in some cases a centrally updated host is a better choice. "
