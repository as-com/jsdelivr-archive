See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help ammending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Is zoomdata.min.js (1.4.0) properly minimized?\n  - Is zoomdata.min.js (1.5.0) properly minimized?\n  - Unescaped unicode characters in _zoomdata.min.js_ (at pos 400586)\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _zoomdata.js_ between _1.4.4_ and _1.4.0_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  - zoomdata.css\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_It's not fully shipped until it's fast._\n"
