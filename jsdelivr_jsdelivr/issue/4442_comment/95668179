      "We always try to avoid removing files between minor versions but some times its impossible to avoid.\nWe have more than 1500 projects here and they all change format, names, code...\n\nAs much as we try its impossible when the author hardly decides on something. \n\nRegarding this case I am cool with adding lodash-compat as `lodash.compat` to jsDelivr and enabling auto-updates for it. Who wants to do it?\n"
