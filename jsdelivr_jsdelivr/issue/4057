        "Great idea to have a CONTRIBUTING doc!\nSince you have to get files ready first before switching on the bot or uploading, I added those instructions first.\nAs per discussion with @as-com &/or @megawac (sorry forgot, few months ago), we decided that `.min.map` files don't belong on a public CDN.  They are used help live-edit code, which is not recommended to do on a production site.  They can host non-minified code if they need to edit their live site.\n"
