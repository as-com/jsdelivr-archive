      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @jsdelivrbot, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help ammending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Is jquery.fancytree-all.min.js (2.7.0) properly minimized?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _jquery.fancytree_ between _2.6.0_ and _2.7.0_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + skin-bootstrap-n/ui.fancytree.min.css\n  + skin-win8-n/icons.gif\n  + skin-win8-n/loading.gif\n  + skin-win8-n/ui.fancytree.min.css\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Responsive is better than fast._\n"
