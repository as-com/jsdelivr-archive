See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- There are some fundamental issues with your PR :no_good:  \n  - _files/Moblify/Moblify-Unminified.css_ should be lowercase\n  - _files/Moblify/Moblify.css_ should be lowercase\n  - _files/Moblify/Moblify.scss_ should be lowercase\n  - _files/Moblify/MoblifyPrint.css_ should be lowercase\n  - _files/Moblify/info.ini_ should be lowercase\n  - _files/Moblify/update.json_ should be lowercase\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - Couldn't retrieve `homepage` website [http://cosmicsearch.org/Moblify/](http://cosmicsearch.org/Moblify/)\n  - Issues validating _update.json_ for Moblify: Expecting object: line 7 column 4 (char 174)\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - string indices must be integers, not str\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Approachable is better than simple._\n"
