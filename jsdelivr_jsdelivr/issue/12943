        "Do you plan to support brotli compression? Chrome, Firefox and Opera supports brotli (see http://caniuse.com/#feat=brotli). \n\nThere are exist currently some CDNs (see https://www.keycdn.com/support/brotli-compression/ and https://www.cdn77.com/brotli for example), some other. One can read [here](https://samsaffron.com/archive/2016/06/15/the-current-state-of-brotli-compression) for example some additional information about the current state of brotli compression.\n\nThanks in advice.\nP.S. I know 8 months late issue https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/issues/7702. It's interesting to me some update on the subject.\n"
