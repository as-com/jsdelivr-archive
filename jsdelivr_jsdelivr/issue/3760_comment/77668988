See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - Where is the jsface's mainfile (_jsface.min.js_) in v-_0.1_\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _jsface_ between _2.3.0_ and _2.4.0_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  - jsface.all.js\n  - jsface.all.min.js\n  - jsface.ready.js\n  - jsface.ready.min.js\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing..
