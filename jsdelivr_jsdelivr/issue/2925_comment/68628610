      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @jsdelivrbot, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help ammending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Expected _proact.min.gz.js_ to be static content; found binary\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _proact.js_ between _1.2.1_ and _1.2.2_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + proact.min.gz.js\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Practicality beats purity._\n"
