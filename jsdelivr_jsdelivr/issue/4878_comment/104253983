      "No Not on client side that's a serious no no.\n\nWhat i am saying is when a person reaches the portal say http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!prettyphoto and select 3.1.5 or 3.1.4 in dropdown they get a message stating security issues are present in this release. and in general we should have a notice for all versions older then the current version that there is a newer version and it is encouraged to use the newer version.\n\nAnd as for option 1 i suppose that might be something you could add as a feature request.\n\nAnother question that will come up is how we can keep a track on the security issues : https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js could be one source for getting that information.\n"
