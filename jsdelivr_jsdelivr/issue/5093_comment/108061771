See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - _.less_ (on _octicons.less_) seems odd to want to host?\n  - _.scss_ (on _octicons.scss_) seems odd to want to host?\n  - _.scss_ (on _sprockets-octicons.scss_) seems odd to want to host?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _octicons_ between _2.3.0_ and _2.4.1_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + octicons.scss\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Avoid administrative distraction._\n"
