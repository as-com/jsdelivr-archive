      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @mkoryak, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- There are some fundamental issues with your PR :no_good:  \n  - _files/floatthead/update.json-packageManager-github-name-floatthead-repo-mkoryak/floatThead-files-basePath-dist/update.json_ should be lowercase\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - Where is the floatthead's mainfile (_dist/jquery.floatThead.min.js_) in v-_update.json-packageManager-github-name-floatthead-repo-mkoryak_\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - _.json_ (on _floatThead-files-basePath-dist/update.json_) seems odd to want to host?\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Avoid administrative distraction._\n"
