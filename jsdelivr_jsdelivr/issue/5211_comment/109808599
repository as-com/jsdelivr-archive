See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Is js/jquery.jqgrid.min.js (4.9.0-rc1) properly minimized?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _free-jqgrid_ between _4.8.0_ and _4.9.0-rc1_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + plugins/jquery.contextmenu-ui.js\n  + plugins/jquery.createcontexmenufromnavigatorbuttons.js\n  + plugins/jquery.jqgrid.showhidecolumnmenu.js\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing..
