        "`mainfile` discussion number 5: What about libs that [require more](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues/1106#issuecomment-43530722) than just the mainfile?  Eg need CSS, images, fonts to really 'work'.  Allow a [browserify](http://browserify.org/) output file to be uploaded?  Have a script to load all resources?\n"
