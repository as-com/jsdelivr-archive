        "I'm not sure if this is the correct way to go about this, but I could find nothing in the actual repo that would let me set this.\n\nOn the Ramda page of JSDelivr (http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!ramda) the GitHub link points to the original development site for the project, when it was part of my personal account.  It's moved to a group account now, and I was hoping that it would be easy to change that link to https://github.com/ramda/ramda.  Is that something I can control myself, or is an issue like this the right way to do so?\n\nThanks.\n"
