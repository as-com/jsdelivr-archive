      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @jsdelivrbot, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help ammending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Is textAngular-rangy.min.js (1.3.0-pre15) properly minimized?\n  - Unescaped unicode characters in _textAngular-rangy.min.js_ (at pos 44766)\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _angular.textangular_ between _1.2.2_ and _1.3.0-pre15_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + textAngular-rangy.min.js\n  - textAngularSetup.js\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Keep it logically awesome._\n"
