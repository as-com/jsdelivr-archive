      "@megawac looking at previous versions of angular.ui-router it seems to me that the 1.0.0 alpha0 and beta.3 versions are inappropriate and that this merge of v0.3.2 would be appropriate to the previous actual release versions of ui-router. I'm not sure how I should proceed, can you give it a look?"
