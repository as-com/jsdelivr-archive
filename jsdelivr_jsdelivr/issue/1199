        "Hallo Team, thanks for the excellent CDN. I'm adding here [MaskJS](https://github.com/atmajs/maskjs) library. \nIs everything well formatted? \nI was a bit confused with:\n\n> If you are adding a project for the first time please add only the minified version\n\nShould I exclude the not minified file from this pr? How then it could be added to the package again? With new release only?\n\nCheers, Alex\n"
