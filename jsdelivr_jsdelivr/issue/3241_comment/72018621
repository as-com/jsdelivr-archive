      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @kenwheeler, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help ammending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Unescaped unicode characters in _slick-theme.css_ (at pos 1529)\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _jquery.slick_ between _1.3.15_ and _1.4.0_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + slick-theme.css\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Favor focus over features._\n"
