        "Hi,\n\nI currently use the following packages: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/webtorrent@0.87,momentjs@2,angularjs@1.4(angular.min.js+angular-route.min.js+angular-sanitize.min.js),angular.ui-grid@3.1,angular.ng-notify@0.7,angular.file-upload@12`\n\nBut I get source maps errors such as: Failed to parse SourceMap: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/ng-notify.min.js.map\n\nI had similar things with some CSS files (moved independently) but now they are occurring in JS... previously not. Is there a way to manually specify the source maps url?\n\nIf every project I use must be separated into independent requests then it will suck.\n\nThank you\n"
