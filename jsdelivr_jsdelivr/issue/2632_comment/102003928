      "Dont use the trunk, use the tags. Trunk gets cached and needs purging and its not recommended to use it. This is much better:\nhttp://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/wp-slimstat/tags/4.0.2/wp-slimstat.min.js\n\nYou can use a wp function to automatically get the plugin's version and insert it into URLs, fully automated.\n\nP.S. I purged the trunk as well.\n"
