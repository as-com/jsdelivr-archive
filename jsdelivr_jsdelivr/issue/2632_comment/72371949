      "Hi guys, I have a quick question about this functionality. I see that the following URL is working as expected:\n\nhttp://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/wp-slimstat/trunk/wp-slimstat.js\n\nIs it safe to assume that it will be available in the foreseeable future just like the \"tags\" version? I usually push the latest stable both as a tag and in trunk (since I use github for development), and by using this trick, I wouldn't have to worry about including the version number in the URL anymore.\n\nThank you in advance!\n"
