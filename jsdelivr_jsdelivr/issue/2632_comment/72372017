I usually push the latest stable both as a tag and in trunk (since I use github for development), and by using this trick, I wouldn't have to worry about including the version number in the URL anymore.\n> \n> \8212\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/issues/2632#issuecomment-72371949.\n"
