      "@pnommensen Each browser only has a few 'spare' [HTTP connections for serving outside Originating Hostname](http://tombyrer.github.io/slideshow-improving_load_times_with_cdns/#Browsers_HTTP_Connections). 4-11 last I looked.  Browsers have 6-8 max connections for the originating, so if the only file served from there is the `index.htm` & all the other files are CDN hosted, then the other 5-7 HTTP connections sit there unused.\n\nReally important for WP sites, since most have <strike>tracking spam</strike>'social sharing buttons' & other service plugins, which usually eat up several outbound HTTP connections already.\n\nYMMV, best to test.\n"
