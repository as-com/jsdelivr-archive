      "Have you tried something like this http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/7112/w3-total-cache-cache-refresh-programmatically ?\n\nWhen you update plugins W3 Total Cache will notify the user as well that he needs to clear his cache.\n\nAnyway if none of this solutions work then shoot me an email and I will give you access to our purging API. You will be able to use trunk and purge when you release a new version\n"
