      "Interesting link, thank you for sharing. Unfortunately not everybody uses W3. Some of our users use SuperCache, others use HyperCache, etc. I wish it was that easy :( How much work would it be to have trunk purged let's say once every 2 hours. If that doesn't work, I'm okay with purging it through the API. Let me know what works best for you :)\n"
