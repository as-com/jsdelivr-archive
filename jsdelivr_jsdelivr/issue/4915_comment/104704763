      "We already have a CDN for the stable version (http://cdn.babylonjs.com/2-0/babylon.js), but it has not SSL access. The purpose of putting the file on jsDelivr is to provide, through an SSL CDN, a beta version not released as final stable but significantly tested (that's why it's not the latest beta) to be considered stable enough for some production projects.\n"
