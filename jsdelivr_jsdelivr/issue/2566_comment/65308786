      "We can, though we consider them \"production\" files since we have found that when debugging live issues, it's helpful to be able to switch between the standard & debug files that directly correspond with the release that you're using.  I would expect CDN users with anything beyond trivial pages to find the same.  The files included in this pull request were downloaded from the release distribution zip at https://github.com/youtube/spfjs/releases/tag/v2.0.0 (tree view at https://github.com/youtube/spfjs/tree/v2.0.0/dist) and it would be nice to have the distribution files match across the release and CDNs.\n"
