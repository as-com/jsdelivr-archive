      "Hi, I changed the structure for this update to correctly mirror our directory structure (in /css and /font folders), but it looks like automatic merging failed. Is there anyway I can correct this or does it need to be manually approved? Sorry, I couldn't find anything in the issues or contributing doc on how to handle this. Thanks!"
