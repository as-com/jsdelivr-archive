        "[Comic Sans Replacer](https://github.com/niutech/comic-sans-replacer) is a user style sheet which replaces Comic Sans MS font on all websites with much better [Comic Neue](http://comicneue.com/) font by Craig Rozynski released in the [public domain](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This web font should be put on a CDN, so it could be quickly downloaded on demand. Could you please add it?\n\nThanks!\n"
