        "Hello,\n\nI'm trying to use the package `angularjs.nvd3-directives` with the multiple files API.\nIt's not working very well and my guess is that because it defines its versions as `vx.x.x`.\n\nWhat's the correct way to deal with this situation ? Submit a PR which duplicates releases without the v ?\n\nI have not seen any mention of what the version format should be by the way, only characters limitations.\n"
