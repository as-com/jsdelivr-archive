      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @jsdelivrbot, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - _.woff2_ (on _fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff2_) seems odd to want to host?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _uikit_ between _2.18.0_ and _2.19.0_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + css/components/slider.almost-flat.min.css\n  + css/components/slider.gradient.min.css\n  + css/components/slider.min.css\n  + js/components/parallax.min.js\n  + js/components/slider.min.js\n  + js/components/slideset.min.js\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Approachable is better than simple._\n"
