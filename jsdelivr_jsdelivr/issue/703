        "Hi everyone,\na friend noticed me a thing.\njsDelivr is hosting handlebars but actually there are 2 different \"kind\" of handlebars, a full code js and a \"only-runtime-js\". The hosted file seems to be the \"only-runtime\" one.\nI don't know much of this project but probably the \"amd\" in filename indicates the \"only-runtime\" nature of the file?\n\nLooking at the handlebars' website filenames are called: \"handlebars-v1.3.0.js\" and \"handlebars.runtime-v1.3.0.js\" so no \"amd\" specification are present.\n\nIn a case like this, how can I fix the hosted filenames? Mantaining the \"amd\" file or replacing it with correct filename like the \"official\" ones?\n\nThank you,\nSimone\n"
