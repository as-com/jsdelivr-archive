      "Hi, \n\nI need to change the file structure to be consistent with my bower releases and other industry standard. I am aware that it is not recommended to change file structure but I really would like this to happen as the project owner and I will provide a note on the documentation.\n\nI am not sure how to change the info.ini file vs. this pull request. Let me know how to proceed.\n\nSorry for this change request I will try to be  more farsighted in the future.\n\nThanks\nArnaud\n"
