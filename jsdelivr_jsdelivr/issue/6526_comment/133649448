      "@akkumar Thanks a ton for submitting the project to jsdeliver! I have to admit I'm embarrassed as I am not able to construct the url to access the files on the cdn :flushed: \n\nI tried a few variations of http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/angular.chartjs/0.7.4/angular.chartjs.min.js\n\nDo you have it handy? I'd like to add it to the readme.\n\nThanks again!\n"
