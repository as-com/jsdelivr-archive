        "Hi everyone. I don't know if this is a known issue or if I'm just doing something wrong, but for my project afterglow, there is a slight problem. The updates are correctly taken from the repo, but the `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/projectname/latest/filename` doesn't update correctly. \n\nSo: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/afterglow/latest/afterglow.min.js still delivers v0.1.1, which is outdates since a few days. \n\nAny idea?\n"
