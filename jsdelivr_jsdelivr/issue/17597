        "I followed the steps in CONTRIBUTING.md to create my basic project files. I feel like it needs more content... Please help, but merge if this is correct! If you need information:\r\n\r\n - My name is Felix Mattick\r\n - The repository URL is `https://github.com/arch-master/US/`\r\n - The filename I need to serve is called `stylesheet.css`\r\n - The current version is 1.5\r\n - The description is:  \r\nThe Universal Stylesheet: the best stylesheet in the universe (or at least I hope so)! This stylesheet is simple but beautiful. If you want fancy navbars or footers, you have to program them yourself, but this is a great starting place for your great website!"
