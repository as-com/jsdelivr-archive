        "The navbar for 1920x1080px screens is huge in height. Right now it occupies a 29% of my screen, almost one third. A screenshot:\n\n![huge bar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2801252/12211588/949753e4-b662-11e5-803f-c188a3b0fe5e.png)\n\nThat screenshot is without any zoom active, in _level 0_ (ctrl+0). However, if I zoom out (ctrl -) then it shows properly. I propose to fix it so it doesn't overflow into two bars so soon, as there's no real state for the content of the page itself.\n"
