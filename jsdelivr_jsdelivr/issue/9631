        "In your [blog post](http://blog.jsdelivr.com/2015/10/new-website-and-sri-support.html) you stated:\n\n> If you noticed one file doesn't have an SRI. Thats because Chrome has a buggy implementation that breaks files containing UTF-8 characters. This bug is not present in Firefox Developer Edition which also supports SRI, but to ensure a smooth experience for all users we decided to temporary stop generating hashes for those files.\n\nmaybe SRI can be re-enabled for all files since you stated it is going to be temporary and as the the issue seems to have been resolved in **Chrome 46** according to [chromium/issues/#527286](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=527286) in December 2015.\n"
