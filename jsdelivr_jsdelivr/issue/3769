        "Hello!\n\nI would be happy to add \"free jqGrid\", which I develop on https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid, to jsDelivr CDN. I hope that the 3-d attempt will be successful. The file `js/jquery.jqgrid.min.js` is minimized version of `js/jquery.jqgrid.src.js`. I used Closure Compiler (v20150126).\n\nBest regards\nOleg\nP.S. The syntax of `update.json` is fixed. The previous pull request https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/3767 is closed.\n"
