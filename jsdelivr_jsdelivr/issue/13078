        "I'm not familiar with JSDeliver, but I'm a developer on Sentry/Raven, and it was brought to our attention that the raven.js being hosted here has an invalid sourcemap.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the problem is that the corresponding unminified version isn't being uploaded to go with the minified version and sourcemap.\n\nSee https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js/issues/675 for a bit more context.\n\nI'm not sure how to resolve the issue here or what the complete ramification of this issue is for uses of JSDeliver.\n\nThanks! :)\n"
