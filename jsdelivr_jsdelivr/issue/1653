        "Hi,\n\nyou mentioned the bot can update files from arbitrary sources (rather than just npm, Bower, etc.).\nThey use semver tags and publish their minified client releases at `https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-{version_number}.js`. I'd love to send a PR with the `update.json` but I don't know how to tell the bot to grab the file from an URL.\n"
