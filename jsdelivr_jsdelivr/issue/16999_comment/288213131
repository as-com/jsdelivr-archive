      "@megawac You closed this but it's a different repo :/\r\n\r\nProbably you thought that it was a duplicate of https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/17002, but it's not! :weary: \r\n\r\nThe other are the themes, and this one is the library itself. Since i use 2 different github repos (the themes are not part of this library since i have more libraries) i think is not  possible to commit a single PR here, so i've created 2.\r\n\r\nCan you please merge this one? Thanks"
