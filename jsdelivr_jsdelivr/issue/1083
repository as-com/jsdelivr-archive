        "This is the jQuery plugin component of Postcodify, an API for searching South Korean street addresses and postal codes.\n\nThe Korean government lets you download a dataset of over 6 million street addresses and associated information as a bunch of zip files. The server-side API of Postcodify makes it easy to convert this information into a MySQL database and search it in various ways.\n\nThe jQuery plugin helps you integrate this search engine into any web page, such as the checkout page of an e-commerce website where the customer must enter their shipping and billing addresses.\n\nThe jQuery plugin can be used either with the free public API that the author operates, or with a search engine installed on your own machine. About one hundred Korean websites are already using Postcodify.\n\nPostcodify is free software, released under LGPLv3.\n"
