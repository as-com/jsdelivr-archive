      "@jimaek Thanks, I'll create a tag.  I want to create a link to my script so I can update the widget when I want.  We're launching in the App store in a few weeks, and I want to be able to redirect traffic there instead of to cancerspot.co, without having to have each of our promoters update their code.  If you have a better suggestion, I'm all ears!\n"
