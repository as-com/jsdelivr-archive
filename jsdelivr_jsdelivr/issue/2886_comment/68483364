      "> jPlayer Repository Refactor: All the circle player specific files are now in the lib/circle-player folder.\n\nI didn't include that skin as it is no longer present in the default `dist` folder and now lives in a separate folder with its own js files.\nIt's probably better to ship it as a separate project.\n"
