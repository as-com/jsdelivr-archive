      "I don't know if they would merge it, if it is leading to a 404. It would work, but it depends on who is merging it, if they would allow it. Also, every time the font gets updated, you will have to fork, commit and send a pull request again. With auto update, all you have to do is update the repo. A bot will check and see that it has changed and update it. If you want you can close this. I have already submitted one that has auto update, and passed the auto tests. \n"
