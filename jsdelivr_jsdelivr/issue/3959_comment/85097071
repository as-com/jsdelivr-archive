      "Thats the problem that me and megawac are having. A `3` in a filename and a vague mention on the website is not enough. \nThe author should tag the 3.0 version on github, or mention it on the README, or make a clearly titled \"v3.0\" download link available. Searching for clues everywhere to find the latest version doesnt look very professional/official. I would more likely assume its some beta version not intended for production.\n\nI think that the requirements are reasonable. \n"
