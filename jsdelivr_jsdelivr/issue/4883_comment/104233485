      "@jimaek Is there a specific reason for not hosting? It's an open-source and highly popular project.\n\nAlso, If you notice the `update.json` file, I've only included project specific files and not other dependencies (No bootstrap, jquery or any other external libraries), they're not at all included. So it's like hardly 5-10 files (Including skins).\n\nP.S Please go through the `update.json` file. It's limited to `dist/` directory and only js & css files.\n\n**Edit:** Exactly 15 files for production (Including Skins, If not its just 2 files, All Minified versions).\n"
