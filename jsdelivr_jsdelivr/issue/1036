        "I want to redesign our infrastructure step by step.\nAnd the first step is our origin.\nCurrently its a VPS running at DigitalOcean with Nginx+PHP-FPM+APC.\nIf it goes down all files should stay online as they are cached by our CDN providers. So DO downtime is not a big deal for us. But still we need to do everything necessary to make sure the origin wont go down.\n\nI want to build a better system to make much more reliable and tweak anything we can.\n- What provider to use? (I would like to use Linode with Load Balancing but its too expensive for me) We need to find some hosting sponsors/partners or I could switch to a $10 Linode VPS.\n- How to tweak configs? Should I create a repo to host them? And then manually upload them to our VPS? This way everybody can contribute and improve our CDN\n- What about bash scripts? Same thing?\n- How to monitor the origin? Currently I stream all Nginx logs to logentries but I would prefer a better system. Thinking about NewRelic.\n- Other?\n  Give me your best ideas. I want to start making jsDelivr even more open allowing more people to contribute and use it. \n  I see jsDelivr as the \"Enterprise grade\" CDN of Public CDNs so every component should be bulletproof.\n\nOnce we get this done we will start focusing on other components.\n"
