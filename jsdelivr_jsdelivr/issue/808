        "Hi there,\n\nWhen I go to the following URL, the latest version of Font Awesome (4.1.0) isn't listed - any ideas why? \nhttp://api.jsdelivr.com/v1/bootstrap/libraries/font-awesome/\n\nIs there a delay of some sort? I can see that this version is available via your CDN (http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!fontawesome), so it seems like it'd be registered when user the jsdelivr api as well.\n\nThanks!\nMickey\n"
