        "@jimaek, Based on our discussion on gitter\njsdelivr/jsdelivr#6373 was merged but the latest version was not deployed by the bot.\n\nThe latest version is 1.3.6\n\nURL: http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/jquery.tagsinput@1.3.6\n\nAs you clarified this is happening because the current version on jsdelivr has a larger version number that what is actually on the repo. Could you please manually push version 1.3.6 to jsdelivr.\n"
