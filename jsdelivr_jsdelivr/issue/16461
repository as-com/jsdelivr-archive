        "http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/jquery.form\r\nThe [jquery-form/form](https://github.com/jquery-form/form) project has changed ownership from [malsup/form](https://github.com/malsup/form).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best practice is to update the library. The canonical URL should probably change to `http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/jquery-form`, but I don't want to break existing links that are pointing to `jquery.form`. Is there anything cleaner than \"list the library twice\"? Maybe a redirect from the old URL to the new?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help. I'm trying to breathe new life into this project and make its transition as smooth as possible."
