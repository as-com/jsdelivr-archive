        "- [lowercase all the things](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ractive-js/lR7_Gz1zwJw) agreed upon.\n- added reactive.min.js to 0.3.6 since I changed `mainfile`.\n- Updated GitHub repo\n\nBTW, think in the future I could just upload only just the minified files for repos that aren't (yet) commonly pulled from jsDelivr?  IMHO only min files should be served, if people NEED a non-minifed file on a CDN, they can PR themselves or toss an issue.  I think I wore out the C & V keys from copy/pasting so much... ;)\n"
