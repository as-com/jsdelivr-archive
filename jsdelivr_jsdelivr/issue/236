        "(moving discussion from #235)\n\nIt would be nice to have version-dependent [latest](http://www.jsdelivr.com/wiki/latest-versions). There are two ways this can be done (examples from that wiki page):\n\n```\n//cdn.jsdelivr.net/abaaso/latest/3.8/abaaso.js\n```\n\nLoads version 3.8.16 if it is the latest version in 3.8 branch. `/latest/3/abaaso.js` will return the latest version in `3` branch: e.g. 3.11.5.\n\n```\n//cdn.jsdelivr.net/abaaso/3.8/abaaso.js\n```\n\nThis will load version 3.8 if there is a directory for it, or the latest version in 3.8 branch (3.8.16) it there isn't. There might be a problem if author doesn't keep version format consistent.\n\n@jimaek: _I want to make the URLs more dynamic but my problem is reliability. With static files I know 100% the user will get the contents of the file. But for example if I create a PHP script to handle different parameters like the versions you said then a lot of new points of failure are added. script code, php-fpm, MySQL, server load..._\n\nWell, latest versions are surely not generated by a PHP script, but probably just copied to some location. The same algorithm can be applied to sub-latest versions (1, 1.0, 1.1, 2, 2.0 etc). Hardlinks can remove any disk space overhead.\n\nAs for one-week update delay, this is a problem. And I don't know how it can be solved \8212 except for keeping a separate \"routing\" server, which receives a request for a sub-latest version, and routes to the correct file. But it will be a SPF, which is bad. Still, it is a task worth thinking about. It will also allow for faster _latest_.\n"
