      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @jsdelivrbot, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n  - Where is the codemirror.spell-checker's mainfile (_spell-checker.min.js_) in v-_1.0.5_\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - _.aff_ (on _en_US.aff_) seems odd to want to host?\n  - _.dic_ (on _en_US.dic_) seems odd to want to host?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _codemirror.spell-checker_ between _1.0.4_ and _1.0.5_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  - spell-checker.min.css\n  - spell-checker.min.js\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Approachable is better than simple._\n"
