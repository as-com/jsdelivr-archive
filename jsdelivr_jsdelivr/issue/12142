        "Hi, I have recently changed the directory in the update.json from Picnic CSS and you accepted the PR. However the project [stays in version 6.0.0](http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/picnicss) while the [latest git version is 6.1.1](https://github.com/picnicss/picnic/releases)\n\nFollowing it, it seems that [jsdelivr is having a not very efficient conversation](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/12027) with... itself:\n\n```\nIt looks like you want to contribute to jsdelivr/jsdelivr, @jsdelivrbot, however [...]\n```\n\nHow can I fix this? Can you fix it?\n"
