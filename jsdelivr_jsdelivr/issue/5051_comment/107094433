      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @jsdelivrbot, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - _.xap_ (on _silverlightmediaelement.xap_) seems odd to want to host?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _mediaelement_ between _2.09.1_ and _2.17.0_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + bigplay.fw.png\n  + bigplay.svg\n  + controls.fw.png\n  + controls.svg\n  + flashmediaelement-cdn.swf\n  + skipback.png\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Anything added dilutes everything else._\n"
