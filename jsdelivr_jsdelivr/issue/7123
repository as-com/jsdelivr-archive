        "In facebook/react#4901 we're going to be moving `react-dom.js` outside of the `react` npm package. For now we'd like to keep that file still in the same project here on the CDN (and we're still distributing it with the `react` bower package). In order to do that we need to point the autoupdater at the repo we use for bower instead of npm.\n\nI think the only difference here is that we store RCs here. We always published those to npm as well but because we never used the `latest` tag, they never ended up here.\n"
