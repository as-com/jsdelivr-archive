      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @RestingCoder, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help amending your PR...\n\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n    - The repository appears to have no tagged versions (https://github.com/restingcoder/discord-widget/tags).\nSee [Github Creating Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) or [Git tagging basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). Auto updating of the library will only take place when `tags` are created.\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n    - In *discord-widget* between *1.0* and *1.1* there was a change in file structure  \n    ```diff\n    + discord.min.js\n    - discord-widget.min.js\n    ```\n  \n----------\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n*Anything added dilutes everything else.*\n"
