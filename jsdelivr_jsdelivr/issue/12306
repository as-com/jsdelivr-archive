        "Looking at https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/tree/master/files/angular.chartjs, the latest version is 0.8.8, however the latest version of angular-chart.js is [0.10.2](https://github.com/jtblin/angular-chart.js/releases/tag/0.10.2).\n\nNot sure why this is happening, there have been errors with the alpha/beta branch because of missing css file in the new version but it is not a problem with 0.10.2 (I'll need to open an issue for the css file later).\n\nThank you\n"
