        "A new feature that I always wanted to have is finally here.\nWe can now automatically proxy any file from the WordPress repository. All you have to do is specify the name and version.\n\nFor example:\n`http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/1000eb/tags/3.3.1/javascripts/admin.js`\n`http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/wp-slimstat/tags/3.8.5/wp-slimstat.js`\n\nThis feature can simplify the integration of jsDelivr for all developers. Now its ridiculously easy to add a CDN option to any plugin.\n\nIt works by proxying http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/ and adding the correct content-type headers. So WordPress takes care of the security audit and adding new versions.\n\nThe proxy for now allows only css,js and font files to be proxied.\nPlease test it out and let me know what you think. Are there any bugs? Any features missing?\n\n@getusedtoit As a WP dev what do you think?\n"
