        "Since i use [release-it](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) to automate release process, [angular.gantt](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/files/angular.gantt/update.json) doesn't get updated in jsDelivr.\n\nBefore, releases were created manually on github in releases page, and it was automatically added in jsDelivr. Now, releases are created through [release-it](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) and won't appear in jsDelivr. \n\nThose release are standard git tags created locally and then pushed to github. Is it the cause of the problem ?\n"
