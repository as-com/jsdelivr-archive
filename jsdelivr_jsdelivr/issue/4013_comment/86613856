See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - Failed to validate pitchpeek: 'github'\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Is pitchpeek.min.js (1.0) properly minimized?\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Non-blocking is better than blocking._\n"
