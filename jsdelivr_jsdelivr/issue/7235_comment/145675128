See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help amending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Is interact.min.js (1.2.6) properly minimized?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _interact.js_ between _1.2.5_ and _1.2.6_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + interact.js\n  + interact.min.js.map\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_It's not fully shipped until it's fast._\n"
