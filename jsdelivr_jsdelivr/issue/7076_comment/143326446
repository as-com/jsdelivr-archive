      "What I recommend:\n1. Use static files with full versions or use version aliasing for only minor versions (1.x)\n2. Don't use /latest/ unless you know what you are doing.\n3. Use /g/ only for combining files and not for a single file.\n\nTechnically you can do everything that works, but I recommend doing the above.\n\n> In the sense of this URL //cdn.jsdelivr.net/{projectName}/latest/{file} and this //cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/{projectName} \8212 the same thing? Only difference in cache time?\n\nYes. They load the same thing using different functions\n"
