      "I'm sorry, but this request looks like its requesting a library that is specific to a single application and not an open source library. The purpose of jsDelivr is to host open source libraries which can be reused across multiple projects. As such, we generally require new projects to have at minimal: some documentation, a source repository or website to download the code and some general reusability.\r\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment on this pull request if you disagree or if you update your project to meet the guidelines above."
