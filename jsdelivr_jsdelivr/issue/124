        "New improvements:\n- Now both classes and enums are declared inside namespaces using\n  \"declareClass\" and \"declareEnum\" namespace methods.\n- Interfaces have been deprecated.\n- Now all classes and enums have type metadata (their name, full name\n  including namespace path, namespace path...).\n- Better event system. Now events are raised invoking \"raise(...)\"\n  method and event handlers are added or removed with \"addEventListener\"\n  and \"removeEventListener\" respectively.\n- A lot of improvements in the internal code. Now all properties are\n  declared using Object.defineProperty with configurable and/or writable\n  attributes in order to avoid human errors.\n"
