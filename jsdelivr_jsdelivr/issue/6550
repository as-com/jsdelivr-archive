        "Hi,\n\nI published (tagged) the version 4.9.2 of [**free-jqgrid**](https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/tree/v4.9.2) on GitHub and published it on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/free-jqgrid) 12 days ago. I did the publishing in absolutely the same way like with 4.9.1 version, but 4.9.2 is still not updated on jsdelivr.\n\nPlease could you verify the reason why auto-updating don't work. What shell I do for refreshing free-jqgrid on jsdelivr CDN?\n"
