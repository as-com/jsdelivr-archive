      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @tomsonpl, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help amending your PR...\n\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n    - The mainfile property should be wrapped in double quotes (e.g. `mainfile = \"\"lib/index.js\",\"`) and contain no other double quotes\n    - The repository appears to have no tagged versions (https://github.com/syncano/syncano-client-js/tags).\nSee [Github Creating Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) or [Git tagging basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). Auto updating of the library will only take place when `tags` are created.\n  \n----------\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n*Non-blocking is better than blocking.*\n"
