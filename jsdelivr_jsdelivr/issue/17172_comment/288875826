      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @gwsetra, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help amending your PR...\n\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n    - The description property should be wrapped in double quotes (e.g. `description = \"\"Accesses the gyroscope and accelerometer data from the web browser and combines them in one JS object.\"`) and contain no other double quotes\n  \n----------\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n*Speak like a human.*\n"
