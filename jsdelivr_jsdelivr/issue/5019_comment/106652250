See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - _.less_ (on _octicons.less_) seems odd to want to host?\n  - _.scss_ (on _sprockets-octicons.scss_) seems odd to want to host?\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_It's not fully shipped until it's fast._\n"
