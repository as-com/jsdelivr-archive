        "Chrome and Firefox will soon be supporting SRI in stable, can SRI fingerprints be added to your interface so users can guarantee content loaded on their sites is the verified library code.\n\nI can't see where the php search code is in these repositories to see, is it not on github?\n\nSo I suspect the tasks here are:\n- At index time compile the fingerprints of the files\n- Upload the extra data to algolia\n- Change the search to return the data in the script code\n\nI would suggest using https://github.com/neftaly/npm-sri-toolbox to calculate the hashes as it is maintained by the spec authors and others.\n\nLet me know if I can provide any help/advice on this.\n"
