      "@jimaek - have a question for ya.  this recent release of ng-notify added a map file and it looks like the bot doesn't like the new file since it's a change to the file structure.  is there something I should have done and/or can do to avoid the test failure here since the project's structure is really unchanged?  thanks for your help!\n"
