        "Hi, this is a question that I asked in Gitter but didn't get a response. So I'm asking here hoping someone can help.\r\n\r\nI'm confused why libgrabber stopped picking up D3.js updates at version v3.5.17, when the latest is v4.4.0 in D3's github repo: (https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/tree/master/files/d3js). It has an auto-update file (https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/files/d3js/update.json) and the repo is properly tagged in git."
