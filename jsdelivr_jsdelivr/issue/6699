        "Hello,\n\nIt would be cool if we could define in which order files are displayed on jsdelivr.com, it order to show the main files on top.\n\nExample for http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!jquery.query-builder, main JS files are at the bottom of the list, which is not very friendly.\n\nA good start would be to respect the order or `include` declaration https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/files/jquery.query-builder/update.json#L7\n"
