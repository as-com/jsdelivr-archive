        "I created a semipopular CSS library named Min. On its downloads page, Min links to its jsdelivr listing, but the link doesn't go directly to its jsdelivr listing. Instead, it lists all frameworks whose names include the word \"min\". This puts Min at the bottom of the page.\n\nThe URL in question: http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!min\n\nIs it possible to link directly to Min's entry?\n"
