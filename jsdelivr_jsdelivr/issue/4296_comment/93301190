      "Essentially the main file has changed from imagesloaded.js to imagesloaded.pkgd.js - this was changed in the 3.1.5 release https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded/releases/tag/v3.1.5\n\nA core developer has stated there is no use for the imagesloaded.min.js in a production environment and therefore he prefers not to include it. So we would have to manually include a minified script that has no use indefinitely\n"
