        "@ping @as-com @watermelonjuice Hey guys, as far as I know you have connections with Asia. \nEither are located there or know one of the languages.\nI was wondering if you would be interested to take a more active role at jsDelivr.\n\nThis would involve:\n- Getting Asian companies to sponsor us. (CDNs or servers)\n- Do benchmarks to improve our [load balancing code](https://github.com/jsdelivr/dns-openmix)\n- Get in contact with Asian open source projects for potential partnerships \n- General promotion of jsDelivr in Asian countries. Maybe even a translation of our website?\n  For example there is no point for http://jsdelivr.cn/ to exist.\n\nYou would be our official representation and could help us a lot.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there any interest in this?\n"
