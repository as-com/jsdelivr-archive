Failed to validate 525icons: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'\n    - Failed to validate 960: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'\n    - Issues validating *update.json* for 525icons: expected string or buffer\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n    - Is 525icons.min.css (1.7) properly minimized?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n    - In *ace* between *1.2.0* and *1.1.9* there was a change in file structure  \n    ```diff\n    - min/mode-maze.js\n    - min/mode-sqlserver.js\n    - min/theme-iplastic.js\n    - min/theme-sqlserver.js\n    - min/snippets/maze.js\n    - min/snippets/sqlserver.js\n    - noconflict/mode-maze.js\n    - noconflict/mode-sqlserver.js\n    - noconflict/theme-iplastic.js\n    - noconflict/theme-sqlserver.js\n    - noconflict/snippets/maze.js\n    - noconflict/snippets/sqlserver.js\n    ```\n  \n----------\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing..
