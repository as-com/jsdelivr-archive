        "Hi,\n\nthe feature to load multiple files with single HTTP request is really awesome. There are problems with file referecnes. Example with fontaweseome:\n\nI load http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/normalize@3,fontawesome@4(css/font-awesome.min.css),jquery.supersized@3.2.7(slideshow/css/supersized.css+slideshow/theme/supersized.shutter.css) in my page. \nFA says \"src:url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot?v=4.2.0')\", so my browser look for it on http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/normalize@3,fontawesome@4.0.3(css/font-awesome.min.css),jquery.supersized@3.2.7(slideshow/css/supersized.css+slideshow/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff?v=4.0.3; Which returns 404, as it is really is here: http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/fontawesome/4.2.0/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff\n\nAny idea how to fix that? I guess it's a problem with every file that references other file...\n\nGreets, pattyland\n"
