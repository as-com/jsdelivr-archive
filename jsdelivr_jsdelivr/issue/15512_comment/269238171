See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help amending your PR...\n\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n    - Issues validating *update.json* for modaal: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 7 column 3 (char 119)\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n    - *.scss* (on *css/modaal.scss*) seems odd to want to host?\n  \n----------\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing..
