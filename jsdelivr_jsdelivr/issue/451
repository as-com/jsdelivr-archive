        "@jimaek I love your service and appreciate the diversity of software you make available. I especially like being able to submit updates to packages I use on a daily basis. One thing does concern me though.\n\nIs there any kind of validation occurring that compares the user-submitted files in a pull request with an authoritative copy of the submitted library? I'm thinking about the potential for malicious code to be inserted to the latest version of a popular package. Could be really bad if, say, a new version of jQuery comes out and the copy that is submitted has malicious code inserted into the .min version.\n"
