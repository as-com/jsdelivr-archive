      "> Yeah completely disagree. .min.map is a good fallback in case something goes wrong\n\nI don't want to stir up a debate, but I am truly interested in finding out how many big (& not so big, like 1000 hits/day) websites would hot-edit their JS on a production server?  I would think most would edit offline & push after testing.\n\nI could see live editing something on Codepen or jsFiddle, but you could serve uncompressed files via https://rawgit.com/  They can mirror GitHub files on this great CDN called [MaxCDN](https://www.maxcdn.com/), you might have heard of it?  ;)\n"
