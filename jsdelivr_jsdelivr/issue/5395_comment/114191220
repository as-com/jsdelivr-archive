You can add the update.json to the old project and you can fix any broken URLs. \nRegarding the name its consistent with our naming  https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\n> If the project is a plugin of a library, prepend the name of the library, like jquery.blurjs or bootstrap.select.\n"
