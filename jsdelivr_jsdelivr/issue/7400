        "Hi guys. I'd like to get usage statistics of libraries I pushed to jsdelivr. I guess it could be helpful for tracking popularity of libraries. What kinds of statistics theoretically can be retrieved?\n-  Number of downloads of latest version. \"Downloads\" mean how many times a webpage with given script is opened. Script must be returned with code 200.\n- Number of usages of latest version. \"Usage\" means script is attached on pages on single domain (example.com/index.html and example.com/blah.html is a single \"usage\").\n- Number of downloads of all versions.\n- Number of usages of all versions.\n\nIs it possible? \n\nThanks\n"
