      "1. Not sure what you mean by 1 PR per project. Do you mean only 1 commit?\n2. Most of the files are seperated by languages as the library supports i18n. Do you want me to concat all the files. Since the library is distributed as different files for convenience to select the different files individually could you advice on what I should do.\n3. I can squash my existing commits into 1.\n\nPlease advice \n"
