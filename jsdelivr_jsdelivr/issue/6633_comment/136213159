See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n  - hostname 'formstone.it' doesn't match either of 'dev.benplum.com', 'benplum.com'\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Practicality beats purity._\n"
