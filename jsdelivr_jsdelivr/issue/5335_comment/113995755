      "I kinda wish `angular-csp.css` included the header-info comment like the .js files do, but it is the same as source.  (& wish it was minified, but that is only a few bytes).\n\nAlso, seems `angular-mocks.js` is not really for production; not only it is not minified when all the other JS in the folder is minified, but seems it is [for testing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13465773/loading-mocks-into-an-angularjs-unit-test).  It is included in older versions, though perhaps by mistake.\n"
