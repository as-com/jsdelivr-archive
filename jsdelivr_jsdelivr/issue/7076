        "Hello. Thank you for CDN!\nI'm very happy to found it :+1: \n\nQuestion: right to use [load multiple files with single HTTP request](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#load-multiple-files-with-single-http-request) for only ONE library? I.e.:\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/jquery\"></script>\n```\n\nIt's request **always** get a `latest` library version. 'Cause browser save in cache last of load version and this URL don't work fine:\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery/latest/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nIn my browser I'll get jQuery version `1.11.3`, but must be a `3.0.0-alpha`.\n\nThe same thing happens with [my project](http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/jquery.goodshare.js).\n\nWhen I send HTTP request `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.goodshare.js/latest/goodshare.min.js`&nbsp;\8212 I have version `3.0`. But last version on CDN is `3.1.3`...\n\nIf I try load only my project as multiple files \8212 `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/jquery.goodshare.js`&nbsp;\8212 I always have **last** version `3.1.3` (**not even clear browser's cache**).\n"
