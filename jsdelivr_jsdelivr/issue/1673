        "It seems that the Content-Type supplied by jsdelivr for the EOT/WOFF/TTF fonts is causing a 403 Denied error in some environments - because it is sending `font/ttf` or `font/woff` etc.\n\n\"font\" isn't a valid top-level MIME type (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#application) - I think it should be using `application/font-woff` or `application/sfnt` (or worst case, application/x-opentype or whatever, since I believe x-NAME is custom)\n\nI'm certainly no expert on MIME/Content-Type headers - could someone take a look at this please?\n\nThanks!\n"
