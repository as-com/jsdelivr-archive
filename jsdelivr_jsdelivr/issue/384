        "Hi,\n\nWhen I search for jquery-ui or jquery.ui (notice the dash and dot) or jquery.validate or jquery-validate (tried lots of combo's, hope you got the idea), it says 'no result'.\n\nBut how come I can just go to: http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.ui/1.10.4/jquery-ui.min.js,\nand see the content of it?\n\nI'm sure that I did find the files in the past using the search field.\nI was trying to load jquery 2.0.3, jquery-ui.min.js, jquery-validate.min.js in one http request.\n\nHow can I do this?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nBy the way, I saw knockout 3.0.0beta (in the dropdown button), and I think it should be 3.1.0beta. Because 3.0.0 is officially out for a while now.\n\nEDIT: it seems that moment, knockout, knockout.mappings, mustache and a few more can't be found either.\n"
