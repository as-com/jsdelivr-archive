      "`Thumbs.db` & `.DS_Store` are system files, we definitely do not host those.\n\nI'm not sure why the `*.less` & `*.scss` files are needed?  Typically you don't distribute uncompiled & not-minified CSS source files via production websites.  You can in-browser-compile with LESS & a few do for 'live' LESS editing, but rare enough.  SCSS requires libsass C++ transpiled into JS; I doubt anyone would use that, & those should all be removed.\n\n[Instructions](http://bootswatch.com/):\n\n> Simply download a CSS file and replace the one in Bootstrap. \n"
