        "The most files of free-jqgrid v4.13.0 (see [the pull request](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/9885)) were not placed under https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/free-jqgrid/4.13.0/. The main reason of that is [the changes](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/commit/bc593f7d67a70f0ce7da13fc847390af42417532) in `update.json`.\n\nSince many last versions of free-jqgrid all files have low case only. The JavaScript files will be provided in two forms: as separate modules which can be loaded via RequireJS for example and as commulative file `jquery.jqgrid.src.js` or `jquery.jqgrid.src.js`. All min files are generated with source map files. Thus all non-minimized files could be needed during debugging. The correct `update.json` now will be the following:\n\n``` JavaScript\n{\n  \"packageManager\": \"github\",\n  \"name\": \"free-jqgrid\",\n  \"repo\": \"free-jqgrid/jqGrid\",\n  \"files\": {\n    \"basePath\": \"/\",\n    \"include\": [\n      \"./css/*\",\n      \"./js/*\",\n      \"./js/i18n/*\",\n      \"./js/min/*\",\n      \"./plugins/*\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAll files from above directories contains the files which will be required either during main loading or could be required for debugging (.map and non-minimized .js).\n\nIf the file `info.ini` is used too, then one should change `mainfile` entry to\n\n``` JavaScript\nmainfile = \"js/jquery.jqgrid.min.js\"\n```\n\n(to fix the case of all files).\n\nI posted the pull request https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/9888 with the changes of `update.json`.\n\nThanks in advance!\n"
