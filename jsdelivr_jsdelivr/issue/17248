        "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am the creator of [embed.js](https://github.com/ritz078/embed.js).\r\n\r\nEarlier the `dist` folder was available on github and the cdn was working fine. Then I removed it from github and added the `build` script to `prepublish` hook of npm. So currently the folder is available on npm but not github. So due to jsdelivr isn't updating. I there anything I need to do ? Any help is appreciated."
