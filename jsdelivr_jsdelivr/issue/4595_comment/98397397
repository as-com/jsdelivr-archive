Here is the github page.\nhttps://github.com/Valums-File-Uploader/file-uploader\nIt seems that the following home page is broken and not working!\nhttp://valums.com/files/2010/file-uploader/demo.htm\nThere is an unminified version in Jsdelivr repository called \"valums-file-uploader\". Since I am beginner here, I did not know if I should exchange the original file with a minified version  so I created a new folder called \"file-uploader\". Please guide me in this matter.\n\nRegards,\nJoe\n"
