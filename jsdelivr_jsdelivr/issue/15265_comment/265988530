See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help amending your PR...\n\n- There are some fundamental issues with your PR :no_good:  \n    - *files/Dummy.js/1.0* should be lowercase\n    - *files/Dummy.js/1.0* should be lowercase\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n    - Dummy.js has no *info.ini* file buddy\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n    - *.ini* (on *info.ini*) seems odd to want to host?\n  \n----------\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n*Non-blocking is better than blocking.*\n"
