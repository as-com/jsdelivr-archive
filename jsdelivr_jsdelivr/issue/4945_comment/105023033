      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @devmgn, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - The description property should be wrapped in double quotes (e.g. `description = \"\" Adds support for background-size \"cover\" and \"contain\" to IE8\"\"`) and contain no other double quotes\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - _.htc_ (on _backgroundsize.htc_) seems odd to want to host?\n  - _.htc_ (on _backgroundsize.min.htc_) seems odd to want to host?\n  - _.htc_ (on _backgroundsize.htc_) seems odd to want to host?\n  - _.htc_ (on _backgroundsize.min.htc_) seems odd to want to host?\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Encourage flow._\n"
