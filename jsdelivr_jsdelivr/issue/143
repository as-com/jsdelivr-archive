I know the file is there in https://github.com/jimaek/jsdelivr/tree/master/files/bootstrap/2.3.2/js. Clicking \"Show More\" seems to show just 10 total files.\n\nI noticed similar issues with the other bootstrap versions. \n\nScreenshot: \n![j72t](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1695972/1515147/cb2f0ae6-4afd-11e3-9cf3-2de728730205.png)\n"
