See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help amending your PR...\n\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n    - Expected a `homepage` (this can be the source repo with docs)\n    - Issues validating *update.json* for egraphql-fetch: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 7 column 3 (char 149)\n  \n----------\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n*It's not fully shipped until it's fast.*\n"
