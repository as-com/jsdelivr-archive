      "Purging is ready. I sent you an email with instructions how it works.\n\nNow regarding the file not expiring by themselves I am not sure where is the problem.\nThe config in CloudFlare is correct. I even pinged their support to confirm this.\nTheir servers will listen to our cache-control header and cache the file for that amount of time.\n\nSo since we have `max-age=604800` the file should be re-fetched 7 days after it was cached.\n"
