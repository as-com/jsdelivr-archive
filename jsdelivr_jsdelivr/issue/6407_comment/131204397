      "http://api.jsdelivr.com/v1/bootswatch/libraries does not exist.\n\nThe only recourse is to use http://api.jsdelivr.com/v1/bootstrap/libraries/bootswatch (which is technically from https://github.com/MaxCDN/bootstrap-cdn and they have all of Bootswatch's versions/themes).\n\nHowever, since this is just and API (with no default base_url btw), I'm left with having to choose how to construct this URL.\n\nI'm saying that there are inconsistencies between what jsDelivr API _says exists_ and _what is actually_ in jsDelivr's repo.\n\nThat's why I was saying that the folders should just be removed and it be repopulated with the _correct_ repo information. I'd rather have the bot do this automatically, than me having to do this manually.\n\nI know _in theory_ it could possibly break someone's site... but this is actually _very highly unlikely_. We'd still have the same files (albeit minus source files like `*.less` and whatnot, but those wouldn't/shouldn't be used anyway).\n"
