      "> /latest should be expected to break.\n\nThis is true, though I think our Readme should be updated to reflect this?\n\nI recommend usually only grabbing the newest point version (in Angular's case, `/1.4/`).  Same recommendation with jQuery; they actively had supported a 1.x & 2.x branch at same time.  jQuery & Angular in particular, there have been many changes including APIs between 'minor' point versions.\n\nThat said, I still don't recommend hosting beta versions, let alone ALPHA versions that are updated every 10 days.  Angular in particular; people can use Google's CDN for alpha/beta which works _almost_ as good as jsDelivr ;)\nEven if jsDelivr can handle the harddrive & bandwidth for alpha/beta, IMHO better to conserve the man-hours.\n\nSo, my vote is -1\n"
