      "Seems like the author had renamed the package since then . ( The info.ini link for angular-file-upload redirects to the new name ) \n\nAnd the filenames are renamed as well.  \n\nSo - submitted another pull request here  -  https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/4822 . \n\njsdelivr bot is not happy for the reason mentioned above.  Let me suggest what are the options now  ? ( a new package vs existing package ) ? \n"
