      "I get same behaviour as before as only the last file in the list gets downloaded\n\nWith the script\n\n`<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/foundation@5.5.1(js/foundation/foundation.accordion.js+js/foundation/foundation.alert.js)\"></script>`\n\nonly the last file is downloaded. \n\nI've tried with Firefox and Chrome, and in the latter I get something which may be helpful.\n\nIn the sources tab, a folder appear under cdn.jsdelivr.net which is called `/g/foundation@5.5.1(js/foundation/foundation.accordion.js+js/foundation`. There's only one asset in it (the alert.js file).\n\nTo me it looks as if only the last file is \"visible\" in the request\n"
