      "Its possible that you are hitting different CDN or POP locations each time. Some never had a hit so they cached the new file and some had a hit before and have cached the old file.\nIts a small problem with low traffic files. But in any case the expiration of files was meant to be gradual and not instant. For instant upgrades I recommend using static links and simply changing the code.\n"
