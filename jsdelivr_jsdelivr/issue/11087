        "I am a long term fan of jsdelivr (ever since you integrated [Picnic CSS](http://picnicss.com/) there) and now someone is making a [pull request to add my library to CDNJS](https://github.com/umbrellajs/umbrellajs.github.io/pull/1).\n\nWhile I have some reasons I prefer jsdelivr, they have a case in that they support http/2, so supposedly compressed headers. I just checked and in the CDN subdomain my standard headers are not even so small. So do you plan to add support to http/2 and, subsequently, compressed headers? Any roadmap/plans if so?\n"
