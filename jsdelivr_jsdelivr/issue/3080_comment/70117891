      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @jsdelivrbot, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help ammending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - Where is the threejs's mainfile (_three.min.js_) in v-_0.0.0-r9_\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Unescaped unicode characters in _three.js_ (at pos 615225)\n  - Is three.min.js (0.0.0-r70) properly minimized?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _threejs_ between _0.0.0-r9_ and _0.0.0-r70_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + three.min.js\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Responsive is better than fast._\n"
