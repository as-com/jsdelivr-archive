        "It seems that old bug of jsdelivrbot is back. I described the problem in the issue https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/issues/10428. It was a problem with merging of old versions (see https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/10383, https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/9208, https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/8703 and so on), but the problem was fixed later (the following pull requests were applied without any problems: https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/14634, https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/12884, https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/11545, https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/10963). Now there are wrong warnings in https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/15497.\r\n\r\nCould you commit the Update project free-jqgrid to v4.13.6 (see https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/15497) manually?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance."
