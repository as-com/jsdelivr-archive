See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n  - jet-composites has no _info.ini_ file buddy\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - _.ini_ (on _info.ini_) seems odd to want to host?\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Speak like a human._\n"
