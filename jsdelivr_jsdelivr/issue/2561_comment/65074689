      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @jsdelivrbot, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help ammending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - _.txt_ (on _fonts/LICENSE.txt_) seems odd to want to host?\n- We try to keep the file structure as consistent as possible between versions; there were some changes in file structure from previous versions...  \n  - In _bootstrap.material-design_ between _0.1.6_ and _0.2.0_ there was a change in file structure  \n  \n  ``` diff\n  + css/material-wfont.css.map\n  + css/material.css.map\n  + css/ripples.css.map\n  + js/material.min.js.map\n  + js/ripples.min.js.map\n  ```\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Anything added dilutes everything else._\n"
