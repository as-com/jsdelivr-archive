        "I know this pull request have 2 commits, but really I dont have any other way to do this. Actually 1 commit is for .gitignore file, and this is really useful file, which automatically ignore the system file like thumb.db etc. This will also be really useful for other users too. I tried a lot to sent pull request with 1 commit, but I had to add .gitignore, otherwise windows by default add thumbs.db.\nIf you can , please accept this pull request, I assure you, from the next time, it will be 1 commit only, per pull request, cause there will no more .gitignore. Now its upto u. \n"
