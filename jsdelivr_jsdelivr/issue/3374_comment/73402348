See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Is bluebird.min.js (2.9.7) properly minimized?\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Approachable is better than simple._\n"
