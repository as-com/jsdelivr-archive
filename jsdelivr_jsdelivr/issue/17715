        "Since MathJax's CDN is shutting down, it would be nice to have a complete copy of all of the versions of MathJax, so jsDelivr could be a drop-in replacement for it.\r\n\r\nI have added a copy of the important files from MathJax's Git repository, based on the files already hosted on cdnjs. I have also replaced the \"2.0\" and \"2.1\" folders with \"2.0.0\" and \"2.1.0,\" respectively. This should not break anything, since the CDN should automatically alias requests from \"2.1\" to \"2.1.0.\"\r\n\r\n@jsdelivrbot will not like this pull request..."
