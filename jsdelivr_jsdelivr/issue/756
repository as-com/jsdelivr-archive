        "cf http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/05/22/self-updating-scripts/\n\nThe idea would be to ask for an asset like `//cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery/1.x+selfupdate/jquery.min.js`, which would return the latest 1.x version of jQuery, with a small suffix and with a 1-year cache header. The suffix would call back to `cdn.jsdelivr.net` and compare its jQuery version with the latest 1.x version. If they differ, it would open an `<iframe>` that contains only a reference to the same `script(//cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery/1.x+selfupdate/jquery.min.js`) and a `location.reload(true)` call to clear the browser's cache of that script.\n\nThe effect is that browsers will eventually catch up to the latest versions of all libraries.\n\nDo you think this is a reasonable fit for this project?\n"
