        "Since Terra is still in beta, tags so far have looked like: `v1.3.1-beta`\n\nI forgot the `-beta` postfix on my last git tag, leaving the project at `v1.4.0`.\n\nI've since renamed and fixed the tag to `v1.4.0-beta`, but jsdelivr doesn't seem to have caught it. I just updated the project to `v1.5.0-beta`, but it seems to be stuck on the old `v1.4.0` tag.\n\nIs there any way to purge (or rename) the erroneous tag and re-scan bower? It's a pretty important update...\n\nThanks!\n"
