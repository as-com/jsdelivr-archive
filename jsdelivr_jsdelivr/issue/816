        "From https://github.com/jamesflorentino/nanoScrollerJS/tree/0.8.0\n\nI minified the CSS with [uglifycss](https://www.npmjs.org/package/uglifycss) 0.0.8. Original CSS also included.\n\nI kept the same structure as the previous version (JS in `javascripts`, CSS in `css`), even though it seems a little silly.  That's the structure in the source repo, but it looks to be more laid out there to support its website (https://jamesflorentino.github.io/nanoScrollerJS/).\n"
