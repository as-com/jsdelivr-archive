      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @christopherthielen, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` or `update.json` has some problems\n  - Potentially confusing file path _./modular/_.min.*\\* with `basePath` set. Consider using _././modular/_.min.**\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Speak like a human._\n"
