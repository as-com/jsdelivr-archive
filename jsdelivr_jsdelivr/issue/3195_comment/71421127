See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help ammending your PR...\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - _.txt_ (on _fonts/LICENSE.txt_) seems odd to want to host?\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Practicality beats purity._\n"
