      "What about deleting `v0.52` and uploading the first version that is available? ( Which would be `v0.2.0` **=>** [arasatasaygin/is.js](https://github.com/arasatasaygin/is.js/releases?after=v0.2.1) ) I think it should automatically add the other versions after that. I suppose that `v0.52` actually was uploaded by mistake because it doesn't exist in the original repository. \n"
