        "Greetings,\n\nI'm not seeing `gzip` working on `https` requests.  For example, the following are gziped via `http`, but not `https`:\nhttps://cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/jquery@1.11.1,jquery.migrate@1.2.1 (35.3KB vs 100.6KB)\nhttps://cdn.jsdelivr.net/headroomjs/0.6.0/headroom.min.js\n(1.4KB vs 3.8KB)\n\nIs this a bug, or am I perhaps missing something obvious?\n\nI've been really liking jsDelivr, but the abscence of `gzip` over `https` would unfortunately be a deal breaker.  However, my assumption is that this is not the intended setup (ie, that it is intended that `gzip` **should** work for both protocols).\n\nThanks!\nSean\n\nEdit (6/24): It is looking like this is only happening with the Cloudflare servers. Read below for more details.\n"
