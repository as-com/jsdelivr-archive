        "First of all, sorry because of the small interval since last pull request... I discovered some important issues in 2.4.0 and that's why I'm pulling 2.4.1.\n\nThis version comes with:\n- Better exception handling approach (see http://mfidemraizer.github.io/joopl/classes/Exception%20handling%20best%20practices.html)\n- Constructors were unable to call most specialized versions of class members (inheritance/polymorphism). Now this is fixed.\n- More detailed documentation!\n\nThank you for adding it to your CDN, I appreciate your effort.\n"
