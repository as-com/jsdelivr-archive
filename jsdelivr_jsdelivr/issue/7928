        "See http://minime.stephan-brumme.com/:\n\n> Surprisingly, most Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) give you a quite bad level of GZIP compression.\n> \n> Google's Zopfli (open source) is currently the best GZIP compressor and produces the smallest files.\n> It produces files fully compatible to the DEFLATE algorithm (used by GZIP) but in order to find even better compression\n\nAs an example, D3 on JSDelivr is 53410 bytes, whereas a version compressed with Zopfli is only 51278 bytes (see http://minime.stephan-brumme.com/d3/3.5.8).\n\nI'm not sure how you compress the files, but I assume they're compressed ahead of time rather than dynamically compressing them for every single request (which would use more CPU than necessary). I don't know a lot about Zopfli, but this might be as simple as changing the way you compress the files when loading them onto the CDN.\n"
