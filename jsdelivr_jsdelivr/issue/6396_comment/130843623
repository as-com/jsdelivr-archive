      "> No mainfile property provided\n\n@jimaek, is this a hard requirement? I can't tell from existing [documentation](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#file-structure). It's also not very applicable here. If we _have_ to put something, is `\"mainfile\": \"cerulean/bootstrap.css\"` applicable?\n"
