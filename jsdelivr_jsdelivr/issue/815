        "How about adding a `/minify` command to jsDelivr?\n\nFor example\n\n```\nUnminified - //cdn.jsdelivr.net/jasmine/2.0.0/jasmine.css\nForced min - //cdn.jsdelivr.net/jasmine/2.0.0/jasmine.css/minify\n```\n\n`/minify` would detect what kind of file it is and would use the appropriate tool to minify it. \nIts an on-the-fly minification command that could be used for files that for any reason are not minified. And since its part of the path it will cached as a real static file.\n\nI can make it work with /g/ too.\n`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/underscorejs@1.5.2,restangular@1.2.2/minify`\n\nWhat do you guys think? \n"
