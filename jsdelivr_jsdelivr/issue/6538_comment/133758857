      "@jimaek these crazy font names are generated by webpack. They're needed for the player to display  correctly. The names won't be different every time, they'll change only when contents are different.\n\nWe're planning to migrate these assets to inline svg, so these fonts won't be around for much longer, but since they're not included in the latest version in jsdelivr, the player is not working correctly.\n\nPlease let me know if this is not recommended, so I can write how to work around this in our docs.\n"
