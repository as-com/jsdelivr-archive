      "It looks like you want to contribute to `jsdelivr/jsdelivr`, @dfedgar, however there seems to be some issues with your pull request. See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - The description property should be wrapped in double quotes (e.g. `description = \"'The packery layout mode uses a bin-packing algorithm. This is a fancy way of saying \"it fills empty gaps\"'\"`) and contain no other double quotes\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Design for failure._\n"
