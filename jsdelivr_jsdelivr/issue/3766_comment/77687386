See [contributing](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr#file-structure) for help amending your PR...\n- Looks like the `info.ini` has a few problems\n  - Name mismatch for update.json in jquery.free-jqgrid\n- Might be nothing but I have some concerns about the files in your submission...  \n  - Is js/jquery.jqgrid.min.js (4.8.0) properly minimized?\n\n---\n\n<sup>Thanks again for contributing.. If you think this review was wrong/unfair/etc. submit a bug on [the bot's repo](https://github.com/jsdelivr/bot)</sup>  \n_Speak like a human._\n"
