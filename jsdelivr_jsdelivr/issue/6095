I think it is an occasion for the library connected via CDN.\n\n[Googling](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:cdn+jquery.unobtrusive-ajax) showed that the network does not have the latest version of the library, and there is only [an old version for MVC3](http://www.asp.net/ajax/cdn#ASPNET_MVC_Releases_on_the_CDN_16), which is not suitable for MVC4 and MVC5.\n\nThanks!\n"
