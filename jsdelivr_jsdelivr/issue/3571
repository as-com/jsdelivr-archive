        "This pull request adds the 0.12.1 release of UI Bootstrap from AngularUI. The files are the versions downloaded from https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ as the project does not keep built files in their repository.\n\nAs with the update to 0.12.0 in #2476, jsdeliverbot may complain about unescaped \"\171\" and \"\187\" characters, which I could replace if that would be preferable.\n\nI hope you find it useful,\nKevin\n"
