        "1. Due to the rendering error (baseline floating) on some browsers, it gave different experience/errors across browsers. Patched.\n2. The main css file at the dist folder doesn't show up properly previously, changed info.ini pathinfo to resolve the issue.\n\nThanks for your attention!\n\np.s. This PR is related to https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/pull/12574 I decided to just add files to the current version rather than copying everything again for the next version tags (such as 2, 3, 4) because duplicates of this kind of resources consumes too much disk space. This measure is to resolve both admins of jsdelivr and my concern.\n"
