        "The mechanism for updating a library based on tagged releases in github works fine. The pull request goes through and the library is updated within 10 minutes generally, in my experience.\n\nBut recently I changed the structure of my project and added a couple of files. I updated the update.json to reflect the new files and submitted a pull request for that. Weeks went by and it was never touched. I finally cancelled the pull request.\n\nIn the mean time, I released a v2.0 version of my library. It actually didn't need some of the files that were originally included, so I deleted them and again put in a pull request for update.json.\n\nBut now my 2.0 changes pull request has failed because the files are not available. If I can't get update.json to update, then I need to add back in useless files to make jsdelivr update the package. \n\nAm I missing something on how to correctly change update.json?\n"
