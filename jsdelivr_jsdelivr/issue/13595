        "Project \"jclic.js\" was updated two days ago from **v0.1.33** to **v0.1.34** in GitHub.\nEverything seems to be OK in JSDelivr:\n- API and project page indicate that 0.1.34 is the latest version, as expected:\n  http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/jclic.js\n  https://api.jsdelivr.com/v1/jsdelivr/libraries?name=jclic.js\n- Direct calls with full version tag work properly, returning 0.1.34:\n  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jclic.js/0.1.34/jclic.min.js \n- Also calls with lower branch version digits are returning 0.1.34:\n  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jclic.js/0.1/jclic.min.js\n  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jclic.js/0/jclic.min.js\n- And it also works fine using the \"merge\" mode:\n  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/jclic.js\n\n... but calling jsdelivr with `latest` (our favorite method!) erroneusly returns the previous version (0.1.33):\nhttps://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jclic.js/latest/jclic.min.js\n\nPlease, can you check it?\n\nThanks!!\n"
