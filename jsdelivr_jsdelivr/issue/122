        "[These smart people](https://rawgithub.com/) wanted to use `raw.github.com/user/repo/master/filename.js` as a host but couldn't because raw.github serves everything with a text MIME.  So they bought `rawgithub.com` setup a proxy/mirror and filtered `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` from the header.\n\nSadly, if you use it in a production site, they blacklist you and eventually start serving evil.css:\n\n```\n/* Don't send production traffic to rawgithub.com! */\n\nhtml {\n    -moz-transform: rotateX(180deg) !important;\n    -webkit-transform: rotateX(180deg) !important;\n    transform: rotateX(180deg) !important;\n}\n```\n\nYou could try and get MaxCDN and others to step up and start really competing with cdnjs!\n"
